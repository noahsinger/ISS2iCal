# ISS2iCal

Very out of date at this point but...


A rails app that allows a user to subscribe to an iCal feel based on their
location. The feed locations and the content of the feeds are scraped
from the NASA website and include orbital pass information for the space
station, and shuttle back in the day.

Overall the user subscribes to their location and their calendar will then
show opportunities when they will be able to see the space station pass over
their location.
